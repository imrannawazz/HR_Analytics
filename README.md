# SQL Project: Employee Attrition and Training Program Effectiveness

## Introduction
This project delivers comprehensive insights into two critical facets of human resource management: **employee attrition** and **training program effectiveness**. Leveraging a robust dataset encompassing various HR metrics, the analysis aims to uncover patterns and correlations that can inform strategic HR decisions and improve overall organizational performance.

## Objectives
1. **Identify Factors Influencing Employee Attrition**: Pinpoint key factors contributing to employee attrition and provide actionable insights to reduce attrition rates.
2. **Evaluate Training Program Effectiveness**: Assess the effectiveness of current training programs and recommend targeted improvements.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
The initial dataset contained several missing values and discrepancies. Data cleaning involved:
1. **Updating Values**: Gender & Position columns were updated for easier handling.
