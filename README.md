# Employee Attrition and Training Program Effectiveness

## Introduction
This project aims to deliver comprehensive insights into two critical facets of human resource management: employee attrition and training program effectiveness. The analysis leverages a robust dataset encompassing various HR metrics, including age, department, performance ratings, tenure, and job satisfaction levels. By examining these dimensions, the project aims to uncover patterns and correlations that can inform strategic HR decisions and improve overall organizational performance.

## Objectives
1. **Identify Factors Influencing Employee Attrition**: Pinpoint key factors contributing to employee attrition and provide actionable insights aimed at reducing attrition rates.
2. **Evaluate Training Program Effectiveness**: Assess the effectiveness of current training programs and recommend targeted improvements.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
The initial dataset contained several missing values and discrepancies. Data cleaning involved:
1. Updating values in the Gender & Position column for easier handling.
2. Categorizing Age and Salary columns for detailed analysis.
3. Converting the Last Promotion Date to a standard date format.
